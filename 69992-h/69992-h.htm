<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> utility of this undertaking at a crisis, when the taste for
Botanical pursuits so universally prevails, will, it is presumed, be
readily admitted by all those engaged in them, whether as theorists,
collectors, or cultivators. Such a work, under the immediate direction
of some principal leader in the science, of this country, has been a
desideratum of long expectance; but either from the great expence
necessarily incurred, before any adequate return could be made, or from
the trouble attendant on publications, where colouring forms so
considerable a part, as yet, every similar attempt has proved abortive.
The Bot. Mag. of Mr. Curtis, a work of singular merit in its way, has
occasionally furnished, it is true, a few specimens of new plants; but
the greatest part, as its title-page indicates, consists of those well
known, common plants, long cultivated in our gardens; the direct reverse
of the proposals and intentions of the author, in the prosecution of
this. From a wish to prevent confusion, it was a determined principle at
the outset of the work, not to give any generic or specific synonims;
but to follow the most generally accepted names, of known and named
plants, without a cavil, of our best English botanists, or cultivators,
if no flagrant error was perceptible, according to the Linnæan system:
being satisfied, nothing contributed so much to repress the ardour of
young botanists as the difficulty of affixing the right name to those
plants, which, (from a captious desire in every publisher, to foist in
something of his own coinage, upon the most trifling supposed
difference,) have undergone several changes of title. If the plant was a
certain novelty, with us, to have followed the sexual system, without a
schism; upon that truly grand and comprehensive scale of nature; when
the formation of a new genus was necessary; if not, to refer it to some
one already made, if such was to be found, in any orthodox author: the
specific name to be formed from some opposed, leading feature, in the
habits of the different species of the genus. But although such were the
Author’s intentions, when he entered on this business, yet, from a wish
to oblige many of the supporters of the work, who have signified a wish
that synonims should be given, an alphabetical Index, with all the
various Synonims collated from the best authorities, shall be printed
separate for the use of those who may wish for such an addition.</p>

<p>As a fair excuse for the Author, (who throws himself upon the candour of
the Public,) in extenuation of the inaccuracies which have, and will
necessarily occur in the prosecution of the work, it is just to say,
that the difficulties to be encountered, and of which none but those
engaged in similar concerns can form any adequate idea, are
incalculable; arising chiefly from the nature of a monthly publication,
composed entirely of novelty, which cannot be anticipated, and of
course, so very little time can be allotted for revisal or correction.
To remedy as far as possible such slips, a list of Erratæ will be given,
with the Index, at the close of each volume.</p>

was known to, and described by all the elder, as well as modern
botanical theorists; yet till this time, has there not been one good
representation of it. Having been nearly lost to us for a number of
years, it may be considered as deserving a place amongst those plants we
deem rare; as a specimen of such it has been given. It delights much in
shade; is perfectly hardy; thrives best in a light but pure soil; as
dung, or other mixtures, are apt to rot the roots when in a state of
inaction; flowering in May and June, and producing seeds. But the surest
mode of propagation is by the root, which may be divided with success
about September.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Springalia, must certainly rank among the most beautiful of the
various new genera which have been introduced from New Holland; the
delicacy, brilliancy, and number, of its blossoms render it particularly
attractive, whilst their extreme permanency adds greatly to its merits;
the flower being of such singular durability, as to retain nearly the
same appearance when the seeds are perfected, as at their first opening.
The figure before us, was taken from a plant in the nursery garden of
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith, who raised it from seeds about
three years since, and where it has flowered these two successive years.
The Botany-bay plants, (as they are generally called) are best preserved
in the greenhouse; but although this is sufficiently hardy for such
treatment, yet its situation must be dry, being very susceptible of
damps, flourishing best in sandy peat earth; continues flowering through
the whole summer; and propagates easily by cuttings. The characters, and
habit of this genus, like almost all the plants from New Holland, being
perfectly new, there was a necessity to form a fresh generic name for
it; which has been done by the deservedly eminent Dr. J. E. Smith,
botanical professor, and president of the Linnæan Society.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">Professor</span> Jacquin of Vienna, having figured the Neottia in the third
volume of his Collectanea, with justice has determined it a new genus,
and given it the name it here bears; the whole habit of the plant being
entirely dissimilar to any old genera. It certainly must be placed
somewhere near Limodorum, or Epidendron, from either of which, however,
it stands perfectly distinct. This is the only species yet in England,
and was introduced from the island of Jamaica, about the year 1793, by
the Hon. Mrs. Barrington. The drawing from which the present figure is
taken, was made (by her kind permission) from a plant in the extensive
collection of the Hon. Lady Archer, Ham-common. Like all plants from
that island, it requires the heat of a pine-stove, and rich earth, to
make it flourish; is increased by the root, and flowers in the early
part of the year.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>This species of Gladiolus, (as are most of the genus) is a native of the
Cape of Good Hope, about Table Mountain; where the roots of Ixia,
Antholyza, Gladiolus, &amp;c. form a chief part of the food of the
inhabiting monkies. It came to England amongst many other roots and
seeds of beautiful and rare plants, collected by J. Pringle, Esq. of the
island of Madeira, when on an excursion at the Cape; and sent by him to
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, of Hammersmith. Like most bulbs, it has its
period of rest; during which, it should be kept without moisture, but
whilst growing, requires abundance; flowering about June, or July, and
producing good seeds. It should be treated as a greenhouse plant, and
planted in light sandy earth. Like the Crocus, the old root perishing, a
number of fresh ones are produced, which may, (if thought necessary) be
kept out of the ground two or three months.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

the number of genera, but where absolutely necessary. This species, as
well as a white variety, which has been figured by Kæmpfer; and
continued since him by Welldenow, in his new Species Plantarum, under
its present denomination; is a native of China, and introduced to our
gardens from thence by G. Hibbert. Esq. of Clapham, from whose most
extensive and beautiful collection this specimen was taken. It is as yet
cultivated as a hothouse plant, where it flowers in the spring months,
perfecting its seeds: perhaps when better known, it may be found, like
many Chinese plants, to bear our climate. It is propagated as well by
parting its roots, as from the seeds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>This species of Gladiolus, although so scarce with us, is certainly one
of the most common found near Cape Town; and, notwithstanding its
extreme beauty, has been overlooked by most collectors; who, from its
great frequency, have generally considered it as forming, undoubtedly,
part of every collection of exotics. It is of an extreme delicate
nature, and overmuch wet easily destroys it; differing from most Cape
bulbs, in requiring a light loamy earth, and the assistance of a dry
stove, to make it flower well; which it will do by such aid, about May,
or June; seldom producing seeds, and propagating but slowly by the root.
From the fugitive character of this plant, it is difficult to ascertain
the first cultivator; for although it does not appear amongst the
Gladiolus in the Hortus Kewensis, it must undoubtedly have come into
that immense collection at different periods, but never flowered; which
is the reason we do not find it there described, which has been done by
Linnæus, in his Species Plantarum, under the name it here bears; as well
as by Plukenet, in his Phyto graphia, and others under various synonims.
This figure was taken from a plant that flowered at Messrs. Lee and
Kennedy’s in 1796.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

under that genus, we have not hardiness enough to dispute his authority.
It is (as the trivial name implies) a native of the Cape of Good Hope,
but at some considerable distance within land; whence it requires a dry
stove to preserve it, suffering much from damps. It is only since the
year 1795, that this plant has been found in our greenhouses; being then
introduced by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, nurserymen, where it has flowered
and perfected seeds; which seems to be the only means of propagating it:
the soil it prefers is a mixture of peat and loam; flowering about

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Aristea is a native of the Cape of Good Hope, and has been described
under various synonyms, by Plukenett as a Gramen, by Petiver as
Bermudiana Capensis, and by Van Royen, Burmann, and Linnæus, as an Ixia.
But although differing from Linnæus is against the fixed intention of
this undertaking, where there is a possibility of avoiding it; yet in
this instance of alteration he must have acquiesced, having undoubtedly
never seen the plant himself. The blossom, seed-vessel, seeds, habit,
root, and growth, of the plant, so totally differ from the character of
Ixia, &amp;c. that we have not hesitated, in accepting the name given it in
the Hortus Kewensis; where, it is said to have been introduced, to that
collection, by Mr. F. Masson in 1774; though no specific description is
given of it; from which we may conjecture, it never flowered there. The
figure here given, was taken from a plant which flowered at Messrs. Lee
and Kennedy’s, in 1797. The Aristea being rather a delicate plant,
requires an airy, warm situation in the greenhouse, flowering readily
about the month of July, or August; requiring to be kept in a small pot,
the soil a light loam. It propagates by seeds, and slips.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

repeatedly, at the nursery, Hammersmith, from whence this figure was

but, undoubtedly, from a dried specimen, as his figure gives no idea of
the brilliancy of this delightful plant. The fragrance of its flowers,
added to the singularity and beauty of its leaves, must place it in the
foremost rank of its congeners. To preserve the bulb of this delicate
Gladiolus, as soon as the stem begins to decay, it should be taken from

treated as other Cape bulbs. It increases by offsets, and flowers about

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the species of this numerous tribe, introduced to us, from the
Cape of Good Hope, this stands singularly pre-eminent; whether for
delicacy of foliage, or beauty of flower, of which, the most finished
drawing would convey but a faint idea. The figure before us, was taken
from a plant in the valuable collection of G. Hibbert, Esq. Clapham;
from whom we understand, that it was sent in 1794 to the Royal Gardens
at Kew, by Mr. F. Masson. To keep this plant in a flourishing condition,
it should be kept in a window of the stove, in winter, as the heat of a
greenhouse is scarce sufficient at that season. It flowers in July, or
August, and requires the soil generally used for Geraniums, a mixture of
rotten dung, and loam; being easily propagated by cuttings.</p>

<p>To dissent from most of the late publications on the science of Botany,
may seem presuming; yet, when it shall be considered, that we take
Linnæus for our sole guide, where that great master has incontestibly
fixed a Generic character, to a tribe of plants, which undoubtedly, came
clearly under his inspection; from his dictates, ours must emanate,
although his authority may be questioned by others. If any good reasons
had been found, to disunite a Genus, which nature has so palpably
distinguished throughout all its numerous species; he certainly, who had
minutely examined so many, would not in his factitious System have
allied them; though nature had apparently so done. We must therefore,
after him, think no Generic division necessary. For the sake of
correctness, where a Genus is so extended in its species as Geranium,
Erica, &amp;c. are; the conformity of particular parts, may form a secondary
arrangement, as we find it constantly in Linnæus; the Heaths, from the
shape of their tips, the Geraniums, from the number of fertile Chives;
which a French Botanist of the name of L’Heritier, has thought of
sufficient moment to create two new Genera on, Erodium and Pelargonium,
retaining the old name Geranium for those only, with ten perfect Chives.
Mons. L’Heritier and his followers must, therefore, forgive us for
ranking one of his Pelargoniums under the old standard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

country; where bees, flies, lizzards, and butterflies are accurately
shaped in the honey-cup. The Genus Epidendrum, takes its Generic title
from its place of growth, being what Botanists term parasitical, that
is, growing on another plant; which is the case, with most of the
species of this Genus: yet is cultivated here with success, by planting
it in a mixture of rotten wood, and loam. A plant, from which this

under various synonyms by most botanical authors from Clusius downwards.
Mr. T. Johnson, in his edition of Gerard of 1633, has given a
description of this plant from Clusius, and a cut; both of which are
excellent (considering the then infant state of the art of engraving),
under the title of Genista spinosa humilis; Dwarf Furze. It is termed
Erinacea by Clusius (says he), from the Spanish name of the hedge-hog,
Erizo, of which country it is a native, in the kingdom of Valencia: from
which we might infer, that, like other plants of that country, it would
live through our winters; which is not the case. It must be kept as a
greenhouse plant, and watered but sparingly. The soil it prefers is a
light loam; is propagated by cuttings, and flowers in April, or May.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">America</span> has furnished our gardens with an extensive variety of beautiful
shrubs; amongst them, the Azaleas hold a distinguished place; some for
the beauty, others for the fragrance, of their blossoms: the present
species far surpasses all of them for both. It is a native of the coast
of the Black Sea, or Pontus Euxinus, through the whole of its extent, on
the Asiatic side, from the city of Trebisonde; from whence its trivial
name. That a plant of such extreme beauty, and sweetness, should so long
have been a stranger to our European gardens, though known to, and
described by, so many botanical travellers, must seem matter of wonder;
but still it is an uncontested fact. Mons. Tournefort, in his Voyage to
the Levant, has given an ample description of it, under the title of
Chamærhododendros Pontica maxima, mespili folio, flore luteo; where he
says, it grows to the height of seven or eight feet, and that the
flowers are of a most exquisite flavour. Dr. P. Pallas, in his Flora
Rossica, has likewise figured, and described it, under the name it here
bears; but apparently his drawing was made from a dried specimen, as the
brilliancy of the flower is by no means preserved; but it is to him we
are indebted for this fine plant. In his voyage to the Crimea and
countries adjacent, in 1792, he procured the seeds of this, amongst many
other valuable and rare plants; parcels of most of which were sent by
him to Messrs. Lee and Kennedy. Hammersmith; by whom plants were raised
of it, and many other sorts, the next year. It is a deciduous shrub,
extremely hardy, and blows early in the spring; is propagated, like
other Azaleas, by layers and seeds; grows best in peat earth, with a
small portion of loam.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the varied genera of plants which decorate that mine of botanical
riches, the Cape of Good Hope, and the adjacent country, no one stands
more conspicuous than Protea. Few travellers who have not noticed the
singularity and beauty of their foliage; indeed they are of such extreme
brilliancy, that no one, however indifferent to botanical researches,
can pass them unobserved; forests of them being so numerous, the Protea
Argentea, or Silver Tree, produces almost the only wood of the country;
growing to the height of thirty or forty feet. But although the leaves
of this numerous tribe are mostly beautiful, many of their blossoms are
but trifling, except in the eye of the botanist: the Protea Formosa,
however, is one amongst many which stand as powerful exceptions: the
great beauty of this charming plant has induced us to adopt the trivial
name it here bears. It has been introduced to the Royal Gardens at Kew
by Mr. F. Masson, botanical collector to his present Majesty; from whose
liberal patronage the science of Botany has of late been brought into
such general estimation. This species, from the downy character of the
whole plant, is apt to damp, if not kept in an airy situation in winter;
though the warmth of a common greenhouse is quite sufficient for its
protection. It is with difficulty propagated by cuttings; and has not
hitherto perfected its seeds in this kingdom. Our drawing was made from
a plant which flowered in the nursery of Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, in the
year 1796, about the month of August.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Correa is a native of Port Jackson, in New Holland, and commonly
termed a Botany-bay plant: it was first raised in the year 1793, from
seeds which were given by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. to J. Vere, Esq. of
Kensington-gore, and from a plant in whose collection our figure was
taken. It receives its generic title from Mr. Joseph Correa de Serra, a
native of Portugal; a gentleman of very distinguished talents as a man
of science in general, and botany in particular. Of this genus there are
as yet but few species discovered; the Alba grows to a shrub of the
height of four or five feet, woody and tough; both stem and leaves are
covered with a thick flannelly substance, particularly the under side of
the leaves, which gives the whole plant a whitish appearance. It
continues to flower through the months of April, May, and June; may be
propagated easily by cuttings, should be kept as a hardy greenhouse
plant, and thrives best in peat earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">That</span> colour bears the character given it by Sir Isaac Newton, our
present subject (as did the prism) adds another proof. The Gladiolus
versicolor might, like the camelion, equally be a subject of contention,
to those who have seen its blossom at different periods of the same day;
for, strange to tell! it is brown in the morning, and continues to
change from that colour till it becomes light blue by night. During the
night it regains its pristine colour; and this change is effected
diurnally, whilst the flower is in its vigour; but upon the decay, the
change is less powerful, gradually fixing in a dark brown; which,
however, does not take place in less than nine or ten days. This is the
only flower, we have ever noticed, to regain the colour that has once
forsook it. A drawing was began about ten o’clock in the morning, but
before it was finished the plant was so totally altered in colour that
there was an absolute necessity for taking a second day to complete it.
The bulbs of this plant were sent from the Cape of Good Hope by J.
Pringle, Esq. of Madeira, in 1794, amongst many others, to Messrs. Lee
and Kennedy, of Hammersmith, where the drawing was made. It flowers
about the month of June; is increased by the root or seed; and thrives
best in peat earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>This genus of Plants must class with Linnæus’s natural order of
Succulents, nearly approaching Crassula in habit; but as the Sexual
System is the basis of our theory, we cannot admit it under that or any
other yet described genus; we have therefore named it after James Vere,
Esq. long and well known for his extended and liberal patronage to the
professors and cultivators of the science; in whose beautiful and select
collection at Kensington Gore, the present species, has for the first
time, flowered in this kingdom. Mr. Anderson the gardener informs us,
that this plant is a native of Sierra Leone; from whence it was sent to
England, by Professor Eld. Elfzelius, in the year 1793; that he has
treated it as a tender hot-house plant, keeping it constantly in the tan
bed, by which means he has made it flower; but from every appearance of
the plant, we should be led to think the common treatment of hot-house
Succulents would answer for this. It is easily propagated by cuttings;
grows to the height of three or four feet, having when in flower the
appearance of a middle sized shrub; blows in the winter months, and
thrives best in rich mould.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

species of this genus (as yet discovered) are ten, from which we may
infer that they are numerous; those only yet introduced to Britain are,
the lævigata, ovata, and the present species; the others are described
by the President, in the second volume of the Linnæan Transactions. This
plant, though not to be ranked amongst the handsomest productions of
that country, so replete with novelty, is yet possessed of sufficient
merit to give it a place in our collections of greenhouse plants,
flowering about the month of August; delighting most in an airy
situation, and light soil. It is easily propagated by cuttings. Our
figure was taken from a plant which flowered at the Hammersmith nursery,
in 1797; where it had been raised from seeds, communicated by Colonel
Paterson, then commanding at Port Jackson; to whose assiduous labours in
collecting seeds, &amp;c. the cabinets and collections of our natural
historians are so very much indebted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">In</span> the Sert. Anglic. of Mons. L’Heritier, this species of Cineraria has

the botanic garden at Kew; where, according to the catalogue, it was
first introduced by Mr. F. Masson, from the Canary Islands, about 1777;
and by which specific it has hitherto been titled: but from what
appearance or part of the plant, he could denominate it bloody, will not
be easy to determine; from our idea of colour, he might as well have
named it blue. Finding, therefore, a specific character certainly more
fixed in the leaf, we have taken the liberty of altering Cruenta to
Aurita; though that would not have been done, (as nothing is more
contrary to our sentiments, than altering any published name) if there
had been any glimpse of affinity to the plant in that title. This is
unquestionably the handsomest species of Cineraria yet known, growing to
the height of near three feet if encouraged. The specimen from which
this figure was taken, and which was sent last March to the author, by
Mr. James Colville, King’s road, Chelsea, had attained that size. By
night it is extremely fragrant, continuing its blossoms from the month
of February, till August; seeding abundantly, by which it may be
propagated, producing many varieties; or by the suckers which are thrown
up from the roots; thriving best in light mould or peat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Though it may be considered by some, as deviating from the botanical
rule we prescribed to ourselves, at the outset of this work, not to
figure any flower, but what could be systematically ascertained; double
flowers, &amp;c. having lost those constituent characters necessary to the
Sexual System; yet having seen this most delightful plant in bloom last
year, the temptation was too powerful to be resisted, for giving a
figure of it in the Botanist’s Repository. This fine variety of the
Camellia, was first imported from China about the year 1793, by Captain
Connor of the Carnatic East-indiaman, for the gardens of the late I.
Slater, Esq. a gentleman of most indefatigable spirit, for the
introduction of new plants to this kingdom; indeed, it is to him we owe
most of the plants received from China within these few years; he having
procured a catalogue to be printed of all the described Chinese plants
in that language, with the descriptions translated, and by various hands
transmitted it to that country. The finest plants in this kingdom, of
the double white Camellia, are now in the collection of Sir Joseph
Banks, Bart. P.R.S. This, like the others of this genus, we may consider
of sufficient hardiness to resist our winters; being a native of the
Japanese isles, where, as well as in China, it was seen by Thunberg. As
yet (from its scarcity) that cannot be ascertained; but from the easy
method by which it is propagated by cuttings, we are in hopes it soon
may. It is at present cultivated as a hot-house plant, where certainly
it will be always seen in the greatest perfection; the flowers being of
so delicate and brilliant a white, their beauty is easily destroyed,
even by watering. Flowers in the autumnal months, and thrives best in
rich loam.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

Holland, from the collection of Messrs. Voorhelm and Co. who about the
year 1793, purchased the largest collection ever formed at the Cape,
from a Frenchman who had been many years resident there. The Gladiolus
ringens about mid-day has the flavour of violets so powerfully, that a
single plant is sufficient to scent a whole greenhouse. It is with
difficulty preserved from rotting at the root; therefore should be grown
in very sandy peat, and should be exposed to dry as soon as the flower
is gone. Is propagated by the root, or by seed, which may be procured by
great care not to over-water the bulb after flowering; but herein there

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">This</span> truly elegant species of Geranium was introduced to us from the
Cape of Good Hope, in the year 1795; being raised from seeds, received
from thence, by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, in whose collection it flowered
for the first time this year, about the latter end of May, and from
which specimen this figure was taken. It is one of those that have in
general seven fertile tips, and, therefore, must be placed under Mr.
L’Heritier’s genus Pelargonium, by those who follow his new arrangement.
It is a hardy plant, and requires only a common greenhouse for its
protection, where it will seed; which seems to be the readiest mode of
propagating it, as it produces but very few branches; thriving best in
rich earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

collection of exotics. We are indebted to the Hollanders for this plant,
as they first introduced it from the Cape; and it is from them we
received it but a few years since. It is amongst the hardiest, and
easiest propagated of this genus; requiring a small degree of heat when
near blowing, to make the flowers expand with lustre; thriving best in
peat earth; propagating itself by the bulb; and flowering during the

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">Numerous</span> are the difficulties which occur in arranging plants according

instances, yet that is sometimes the case. The plant before us, although
in habit, fruit, &amp;c. seemingly perfectly allied to Vaccinium, and, from
which characters, it has been placed under that genus, yet we doubt
whether if Linnæus had examined the flower himself, (as he has accepted
it under the name it here bears, and we have no doubt of its being the
plant intended;) he would not have classed it in Octandria; for
certainly it has in every instance ten chives, with the border of the
blossom of five segments; the threads attached to the blossom. But, as
it is the professed intention of this work as little as possible to
confuse, by the introduction of new names for plants already known by
established, and generally accepted ones; though erroneous from
incorrectness, or otherwise, in the author who first published them; we
shall attempt an alteration but rarely, and that cautiously, or for very
glaring reasons; being thoroughly convinced of the difficulty of
retaining only one name for each plant. The Vaccinium Arctostaphyllus is
a native of the island of Madeira, where it grows to a considerable
height: it has not been many years cultivated in our gardens; having
been introduced to us first by Mr. F. Masson about the year 1786. The
winters in common of this climate are too severe for it, therefore
should be protected, although it will survive a mild one: it is best
preserved in a pot, and kept as a greenhouse plant, where it is very
ornamental; flowering about the months of July and August; thriving best
in light mould, or peat; and is propagated by cuttings, or the seed,
which it produces in abundance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

specific character is copied. This plant, as well as most of the genus,
are subject to lose their leaves from the lower part of the stem, which
gives it rather a naked appearance when not in flower; but that is amply
compensated by the very handsome appearance of its magnificent bunch of
yellow blossoms. It grows to the height of three or four feet, producing
but few branches. This figure was taken from a plant sent to the author,
about the beginning of July, in full bloom, by Mr. Colville, nurseryman,
of the King’s Road, Chelsea; who informs him that he raised it about the
year 1795, from seeds which he had received from the Cape of Good Hope.
The Borbonias are mostly hardy greenhouse plants, and delight in light
earth; either peat, or very light dungy earth: they are in general
difficult to propagate by cuttings; the surest method is by the seed,
which they for the most part perfect in this climate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

roots, which should be done in spring, about the month of March. The
proper season of its flowering cannot well be determined, as it has
undergone such various treatment. The plant from which this figure was
made was in full bloom at the gardens of G. Hibbert, Esq. Clapham, in
the month of June 1797, where it was seen to flower, for the first time
in this country. The soil it seems to thrive in most, is a composition
of loam, and rotten dung.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

shape, having the appearance of being the half, rather than the whole;
it is very delicate, is easily destroyed by moisture, therefore (except
when in flower) should be kept very dry; it propagates by the root, the
old one generally producing two; flowering about the month of June, or
July, but requires the warmth of a moderate hothouse to expand its
blossoms. Like other Cape bulbs, it should be planted in sandy peat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

settlements of Carolina, North America, where it is native. This species
is by far the most delicate of any yet discovered on that continent;
grows to the height of three, or four feet, and of sufficient hardiness
to resist our winters in the open ground; a slight protection insures
its flowering, as our late frosts are apt to injure the buds, which are
very often without that assistance destroyed. The best method of
propagating this shrub is by layers, which should be taken off in
autumn, and protected the first winter. It flowers about the month of
July, at which season this year a drawing was made from a plant, in the
nursery of Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith. It (like most American plants)
delights in sandy peat.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

having called it after a botanist of the name of De la Chenal; and under
which it is now generally known; therefore we have not replaced it under
its old title, though we have authority of such weight to corroborate
our opinion. The Lachenalias are natives of the Cape of Good Hope, yet
are of so hardy a nature as to require no farther protection than
shelter from the severe frosts. Our species is the handsomest yet known,
flowering about September; was, according to the Kew catalogue,
introduced there by Mr. F. Masson in the year 1774. It was from a plant
in the extensive collection of G. Hibbert, Esq. Clapham Common (to whose
kind communications the author acknowledges himself much indebted), that
this figure was taken, the latter end of September this year. No plant
is more easy or certain to increase than this; the young offsets are
produced in such abundance from the old bulb, which delights in a light
soil; but its flowering is not so certain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

the states from Virginia as far north as Canada: it has been treated of
by Ray, Morison, Gronovius, Royen, Linnæus, and others; but although so
long known by name, it was not introduced to our gardens before the year
1796; having been sent that year from Philadelphia by Mr. J. Lyons, from
the gardens of J. Hamilton, Esq. to Messrs. Lee and Kennedy,
Hammersmith; at whose nursery it flowered this year, in the month of
July, when the drawing was made. It is a hardy herbaceous plant,
thriving best in a shady border, and should be planted in a mixture of
loam and peat earth. The propagation of this plant, like most of the
genus, is difficult, the seeds being too small to be collected, and the
root seldom producing more than one bud.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">This</span> species of Bignonia is well known in most collections of hothouse
plants, and was first introduced to the Chelsea gardens by Mr. P.
Miller, the then gardener, in 1759, and may be found described in his
Dictionary; but, notwithstanding its frequency, few have seen its
blossoms. Owing to the naked appearance of the stem, and its growing to
so considerable a height before it flowers, and that but rarely, has
rendered it a plant but of little consideration; though perhaps, from
the great beauty of its blossoms, it deserves more attention. Being a
native of the West Indies, it does not flourish without the assistance
of tan heat; but will live in any situation of the hothouse; thriving
best in a mixture of loam and peat, and is readily propagated by
cuttings. It was from a plant in the select and valuable collection at
Paddington, belonging to the Hon. Dowager Lady De Clifford (to whom the
author, as well as all the cultivators and professors of the science,
stand much indebted for the zeal and patronage which her ladyship has
shewn, in her endeavours to promote it), that this figure was taken in
July this present year 1798.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

described it under the name it here bears; but till the year 1792 we had
no knowledge of it, when it was first introduced by Messrs. Lee and
Kennedy, Hammersmith, from the Cape of Good Hope; at whose nursery it
flowered the following year; where it continues to blow annually, and
whence this figure was taken. It is rather a tender bulb, small, and
easily rotted; should therefore be placed in the warmest part of the
greenhouse, and kept dry when out of flower; is rather difficult to
increase, as each bulb seldom produces more than one offset, nor that
always, and rarely seeds.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

sometimes to the length of three feet, giving it a very singular
appearance: it should be treated like the Cape Ixias, and protected from
the weather, whilst in bloom, as the flower is injured by the lightest
wind, and the duration of each blossom is but a few hours; there is,
however, a good succession, which rise diurnally from the same sheath,
seldom more than one at a time. This figure was taken in the month of
June 1797 at the Hammersmith nursery. It has a singular mode of
propagating itself; the old root dying, two young ones are formed above
it, from whence the flower-stem arises: seldom ripe seeds are produced.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

now exploring the untrod regions of North America, to add to the
extensive collections of his royal and munificent Master, which stand so
much indebted to his indefatigable industry for their present splendour.
The Massonias are all rather tender, and require the same situation as
Hæmanthus &amp;c; that is, a dry stove; they are natives of the Cape of Good
Hope, or, at least, grow within that point of Africa generally so
called, but at some distance from the Cape town, near a mountain
(according to Thunberg) of the name of Bocklands Berg. The root of this
species is very subject to rot when the leaves are decayed, if watered
at that time; therefore, like the Ixias, should be put aside, or taken
out of the pot for two or three months, after flowering. It is very
difficult to propagate, as the seeds are seldom perfected, and rarely
makes any offsets; flowering in September, about the beginning of which
month this figure was taken, from a plant in the collection of G.
Hibbert, Esq. Clapham Common. It appears to thrive best in a mixture of

where, as well as in Cochin-China, Sumatra, Java, &amp;c. it is very
commonly found. Our figure was taken, in part, from a plant which
flowered at James Vere’s, Esq. Kensington Gore, last December, and
partly, from one in blossom about the same time, at the Hon. Lady
Archer’s, Ham Common. The Musa Coccinea grows to the height of about
three, or four feet before it blows, and without question, has no rival
but Strelitzea Regina in the hothouse, where its brilliancy, tends in
some degree, to dispel the gloom of winter, for at least three months.
It increases itself by suckers, which are thrown up in abundance from a
vigorous plant; may be taken off at any time, and will arrive at a
flowering size in twelve months; if planted in rich earth, and kept
growing in pine heat, or on a strong hotbed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> singular sporting of Nature in the Ixia bulbifera is not uncommon;
its viviparous character (if it may be so called) constitutes a specific
difference in many genera; Lilium, Lysimachia, &amp;c. partake of it. The
bulbs produced from the stem blow the second year, whereas those from
seeds do not till the third. The flowers of this variety are the first
that open, amongst the numerous species yet introduced, of this
extensive genus; they are of a brilliant yellow, and seldom expand more
than one at a time. The usual treatment of other Cape Ixias is suitable
for this. The drawing was made at Messrs. Lee and Kennedy’s, in the
month of March 1798, they having introduced it about the year 1784.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

is not the Verbascifolium of Linnæus; or indeed if they are not both the
same plant, named from different specimens. Our species makes a very
handsome hothouse plant, growing to the height of five, or six feet,
before it flowers. It is a native of Jamaica, and most of the adjacent
islands, and was introduced by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy about the year
1792. From the extreme tenderness of the young leaves, and shoots, it
must be kept in a strong growing pine heat during the winter months;
otherwise, they are subject to damp off. It is raised by cuttings, and
seems to delight in a rich soil. The figure was made from a specimen
communicated by the Right Hon. Lord Viscount Courtenay, in whose most
superb collection at Powderham Castle, near Exeter, it flowered, for the
first time in England, in the month of September 1798.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

from our winter damps; therefore requires a dry stove for its

persistent parts) are easily preserved for many years, in all their
brilliancy, by cutting them, when they first expand; but our atmosphere
seems uncongenial to the ripening of their seeds, and is with great
difficulty increased by cuttings. The soil it most approves is sandy
peat, with a small portion of loam. Our figure was taken in September

alike in them all; and to us, appear noticeable in their small

our plan is not to alter, upon any terms, what has been determinately
settled by that great master in the arcana of nature, let our opinions
be what they will; we are determined to prevent confusion (which has
been but little attended to of late), to give it only as such, without
presuming upon alteration. But as in the present instance, when a plant
long named, but otherwise unknown to cultivators, has unfortunately been
foisted from its rank by another, no ways answering to the characters of
the describer; we shall consider it as our particular province to
rectify the mistake, however generally the error may have obtained.&#8212;The
Gnidia pinifolia is a native of the Cape of Good Hope, the seeds having
been received from thence in 1795, by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy,
Hammersmith, at whose nursery it has flowered, for the first time in
England, in the month of February this year, and where the drawing was
taken. It is a hardy greenhouse plant, but is propagated with difficulty
by cuttings; growing to the height of eighteen inches, being most
exquisitely scented by night, continuing in flower at least three
months, and thriving best in a light peat soil.</p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">This</span> species of Aletris was introduced to us, from the Cape of Good
Hope, about the year 1789; it is a hardy plant, requiring the same
management as Aletris Capensis, that is, to be kept in a dry part of the
greenhouse; although the plant should be frequently watered when in
bloom, as should mostly all plants, notwithstanding (as in the present
instance is the case) their flowering in the winter months. This caution
we have thought necessary, as it is a general rule with gardeners during
that season, to put as little moisture as possible to their plants,
whether in flower or not, to avoid damps. The little difficulty in
propagating this handsome species of Aletris, will render it soon
common; the roots grow nearly horizontally, and from their joints
numberless young plants are produced; which character we were desirous
of expressing in the figure, as from thence we have taken our trivial
name; but from the size of the work, it was found impracticable. The

Cavanilles, in his first volume of Spanish plants; where he says, it is
a native of Mexico, South America, and was transmitted from thence to
the royal gardens, where it perfected its seeds. In the year 1796, the
Marchioness of Bute received it amongst many other curious seeds, from
Madrid, through the medium of Professor Ortega. Being rather a tender
annual, it should be sown in March, on a gentle hotbed; and transplanted
into the open borders the beginning of May. The plant grows to the
height of three feet or more, and makes in the months of August and
September, a very considerable addition to the splendor of the flower
garden. The seeds ripen freely, though the flower should be plucked
before it appears decayed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

unfortunately, is seldom the case with the flowers of this genus. It was
received from the Cape of Good Hope in bulbs, sent by J. Pringle, Esq.
of Madeira, in 1794, to Messrs. Lee and Kennedy of Hammersmith; the
drawing was made in the month of June 1797 at their nursery. Not being
easily injured by damp, there is no necessity for removing it from its
pot, as is necessary for most bulbs, but to increase it; one, or two
young bulbs being annually produced, in addition from the old one. The

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">This</span> is the only species yet in our gardens, of a most beautiful new
genus of plants, natives of New South Wales, first named, described, and
with three other species, figured in the <i>Tracts relating to Natural
History by Dr. J. E. Smith, F.R.S. P.L.S. &amp;c.</i> Thus eternizing the name
of an esteemed and faithful servant, who by his ardour in botanical
pursuits, had merited the honour; rejecting the usual considerations,
riches, or learning, does the Dr. no less credit as a man, for the
kindness of his heart, than what his distinguished talents have gained
him, by placing him in the first botanical seat in this kingdom. In the
short history of the unfortunate end of Borone, the Dr. informs us, he
had resigned him to Dr. Sibthorpe, as a most fit person to attend him in
his last journey through Greece; where, at Athens, he met his death, by
an accidental fall from a balcony: the Dr. did not long survive him.</p>

<p>The Boronia pinnata has much of the aromatic flavour of Diosma in its
leaves and stem; the flowers, which appear about February, and continue
till May, have the scent of the Hawthorn flower; it grows to a shrub of
the height of eighteen inches, is propagated with difficulty by
cuttings, and has not hitherto perfected its seeds in this country;
requiring a dry situation in the greenhouse, and flourishes most in
light sandy peat. The figure was taken from a plant which flowered last
year, in the nursery of Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith, where it
was raised from seeds in 1794.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

Messrs. Lee and Kennedy’s, Hammersmith, who had some of them in a

licence necessary, and we implicitly follow him. Thus far we have
thought proper to extenuate in the present instance; for should we
follow Mons. L’Heritier, (as most of the modern correctors of Linnæus
have done,) a new genus must inevitably be formed for this plant. Upon a
close examination of the flowers, from a dozen different plants,
invariably, only seven threads were found; two only with tips, and those
placed immediately behind the shaft, whose summits were but four. This
Geranium is rather tender, and requires a dry-stove heat to make it
flower, which it will readily do with such assistance, in April; about
the beginning of which month, this year, a drawing was made from a plant
in the collection of Messrs. Lee and Kennedy. The roots or bulbs of this

beautiful of the vegetable productions of New Holland; but nevertheless,
from the continuance of its flowering, is very desirable as a greenhouse
plant, as it begins to expand its blossoms about December, and from that

shrub, seldom exceeding a foot in height, and very branching. Like most
plants from Botany Bay, it delights in a light sandy peat soil, is
easily propagated by cuttings, and seeds. The drawing was made from a

into it; as it is deficient in most of the essential characters; having
a blossom without a tube, and the petals equal. From the Kew Catalogue
we learn it was introduced in the year 1787, by Mr. F. Masson, to the
royal gardens; is there said to flower most part of the year: a plant of
such character is most desirable, but unfortunately we have never seen
it in blossom but at the usual season for the flowers of this tribe;
that is, from April till June. The capsules of this plant bear a strong
resemblance to those of the Euonymus: generally perfecting their seeds.
It is a very hardy bulb, blows early, and may be kept in a pit protected
from the frost.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

winters. It has been described by Gmelin, in his Flora Sibirica; and
figured by Dr. Pallas, in his Flora Rossica, under the specific title it
here bears. J. Bell, Esq. of Isleworth, procured some plants of it from
St. Petersburg, about the year 1791; where it had been introduced by Dr.
Pallas some time before, when on his travels through Tartary. It forms a
handsome, upright growing, herbaceous plant; the flowers standing much
above the foliage, are much handsomer before they are expanded, than
when fully so; as the under part of the petals are tinged with red,
which contrasted with the purity of the white of the other parts,
renders them at that period extremely beautiful. The figure was taken at
the nursery of Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, this year, in the month of June,
during which month it is in perfection. Like the rest of the Pæonies, it
is easily propagated by the root; requiring little attention in its
cultivation, as it will live in almost any soil or situation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

likewise, but thought it only a large variety of a species found in
marshy grounds in Sweden; however that may be, it is perfectly new to
Britain, as a plant in our gardens. This species of Ophrys seems much
more easy to preserve than most of its congeners, as, since its
introduction, the bulbs seem to acquire additional size, and the spikes
of flowers to grow larger each year. Our drawing was taken from a plant
in the extensive collection of the Right Hon. the Marquis of Blandford,
Bill-hill, Berkshire, in the year 1797, about the beginning of the month
of July; having been sent the preceding year from Philadelphia, by J.
Lyons, gardener to William Hamilton, Esq. of that State. It is a hardy
plant, and will thrive in a sheltered border, if planted in light earth,
and kept moist; is propagated but slowly by the root, which seems the
only method; as the seeds are too small of all this natural order to
raise them by that means.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

upright character of the chives, their insertion into the tube of the
blossom, and not at the mouth, the difference in the shape of the
petals, the situation of the summits behind the chives, &amp;c. leave no
room for doubt where its station should be. Although plentiful at the
Cape, it has not been long an inhabitant of this clime; having flowered
for the first time in the year 1797, at Bulstrode, the seat of his Grace
the Duke of Portland. What contributes much to the value of this plant
is, that it continues in flower at least two months, from the beginning
of June till the end of July; propagates itself abundantly by the roots,
which are not subject to rot, though not removed from the pots in which
they have flowered. Thrives in peat earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">In</span> the second volume of the Linnæan Transactions, Dr. Smith enumerates
ten species of the genus Goodenia; this species makes an addition to the
number. The oval-leaved Goodenia is a half woody plant, making long
willow-like branches, which mostly decay in the winter, though a great
part of the plant remains; it is a hardy greenhouse plant, requiring
little trouble either to keep or propagate; the latter of which is done
by cuttings. About the year 1793, a parcel of seeds was received by
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, sent to them by Colonel Paterson from Port
Jackson, New Holland; amongst them, the seeds of this plant; it
nevertheless did not flower till the year 1798, about the month of June.
It is certainly a desirable plant, never failing to flower from June
till September, if kept growing in vigour, which it will surely do if
planted in light peat earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">Of</span> all the plants yet introduced from New Holland, that have hitherto
flowered with us, this unquestionably takes the lead for beauty,
considering the plant altogether. It is a hardy greenhouse plant,
growing to the height of six or eight feet before it flowers; when the
blossoms break from the ends of almost every branch. The seeds of this
plant were among the first which arrived from Botany Bay, in the year
1788; when two varieties of it were raised by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy,
at their nursery, who were fortunate enough to procure all the seeds
which came home that season. This fine genus has received its title,
(under the sanction of Dr. Smith, <i>see the Linn. Trans. page 214, vol.
3</i>.) from Aylmer Bourke Lambert, Esq. fellow of the Royal and Linnæan
Societies; a gentleman whose zeal for the advancement of the science is
unbounded, and whose labours to that end, as well as his endeavours to
render botany of universal benefit, by combining the useful with the
pleasing; (witness his work on the Cinchonas, or Jesuits’ Barks) do him
the greatest credit. Our drawing was made from a plant which flowered
for the first time in this kingdom, in the collection of J. Robertson,
Esq. of Stockwell, Surrey, in July 1798. It is without difficulty raised
by cuttings, and thrives in peat earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

synonims, in his Sp. Plan. By collating the different specific
characters from the synonims adopted by him, we have no hesitation in
our decision. Being a native of Virginia and Carolina, it is not so
hardy as some others from the northern parts of Europe or America; but,
nevertheless, is not killed by our winters, as it is herbaceous, and not
making its shoots till late. In a warm situation against a wall or
trellis, it will begin to blossom in July, and continue to flower till
destroyed by the frost. As yet it is rather scarce in our gardens, being
but of a late introduction, though long known by description. Our figure
was taken at the Hammersmith nursery, where it is in high perfection,
being planted in a mixture of loam and peat earth: it is most readily
increased, by parting the roots in spring; as the seeds seldom come to
maturity in this climate.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Styphelias constitute a very extended tribe of plants, indigenous
only to New Holland; we are indebted to the pupil of Linnæus, the
celebrated Dr. Solander, for this generic title, which, (as Dr. Smith
has fairly observed) is expressive of the habit of this whole genus,
having its origin in στυφελὸς, harsh, or hard; a character which seems
invariable in every species that has come under our notice. The S.
tubiflora, although set off by Dr. Smith, in his fourth number of New
Holland Botany, with so much grace, must, (and we have no doubt of his
concurrence) give place to S. triflora, which undoubtedly claims the
palm from all its congeners hitherto discovered. The only specimen alive
or dead, and from which our figure was taken, of this plant, which has
come to our knowledge, is to be found in the extensive collection of G.
Hibbert, Esq. Clapham-common; from whose exertions the exotic
collections of this kingdom, are likely to acquire such considerable
additions.</p>

<p>The S. triflora was raised from seed at Clapham in 1796, but did not
flower till this year, in the month of June, continuing in blossom
through July, and part of August. It grows to the height of near three
feet, branching but little; the whole stem being hid by the leaves. Mr.
Allen the gardener, to whose kind communications we are much indebted,
informs us he has kept it in peat earth, and that he thinks it is to be
raised by cuttings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">Tournefort</span> in his Voyage to the Levant, Vol. III. has described this
plant under the name of, Thymelæa Pontica Citrei foliis; Dr. P. Pallas
in his Flora Rossica, has likewise figured and described it, under the
title it bears in the Sp. Plan. p. 511; from both of whom we learn, that
it is a native of the coast of the Black Sea, and therefore perfectly
hardy, at least sufficiently so to endure our climate. It is the
handsomest in foliage of any species of the genus, having, like most of
them, fragrant flowers; which begin to shew themselves with the first
budding of the plant in spring, about the first week in March. Like our
common Spurge-laurel it delights in shade, making a pretty evergreen
shrub, about two feet in height; and grows best in a light loamy soil.
Although this plant has been long known by name, it had not been seen in
England till 1795, a year subsequent to its being sent in seeds to
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith. It flowered for the first time
here, in 1798; but our drawing was not made till this year, about the
middle of April. It is propagated by the seed, or cuttings.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

us with a perfectly new face; such is the object of our present
consideration. Dr. Smith, P. L. S. in the Linnæan Transactions, Vol.
IIII. p. 215, considering a new Genus as necessary for this tribe of
plants, has named it in honour of C. H. Persoon, much noted for his
works on the fungi. This is a handsome, spreading greenhouse plant,
growing about five feet high, and covering itself with deep yellow
blossoms. It is propagated by cuttings, or seeds, which come to maturity
with us, and are produced in great numbers. J. Willson, Esq. of
Islington, raised this species from seeds about the year 1791; from a
specimen in whose collection our figure was taken, this year in July,
and where it flowered for the first time last year, in the month of
August, and is still in bloom, although many seeds are already
perfected, from the flowers of last year.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

in his Stirp. Nov. p. 43. t. 22; and was first transmitted to England in
the year 1782, by Mons. Thoin, from France. Although it has been
cultivated here some years, it is but little known, owing to its great
delicacy when young, being very liable to damp off in the hotbed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

makes a very fine appearance when in bloom, growing to the height of two
feet or more upright, and with few branches; every part of the plant,
(which is uncommon in this genus,) is quite smooth and shining. This
species of Protea is an inhabitant of our gardens, since the year 1780;
when it was first introduced by William Forsyth, Esq. of Kensington, but
has been rarely seen to flower, as it is found but in few collections;
owing to the difficulty of propagating it, by the only possible method
in this country, cuttings. The soil it approves most, as do most of the
Proteas, is a light loam. The drawing was taken at the Hammersmith
nursery, from a plant which flowered there in August this year.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

begin to expand about the beginning of August, and continue to blow in

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> number of handsome flowering plants from New Holland, already
figured in the Botanist’s Repository; leads us to hope, the first, and
indeed most generally prevailing opinion, that the insignificance of the
flowers produced by the plants of that country, rendering them scarcely
worth cultivation for ornament; must be nearly, if not quite done away:
and we have reason to think, when farther explored, few countries will
be able to stand a competition with it, for the singularity, variety, or
beauty of its vegetable productions. The Willow-leaved Crowea we
consider as one amongst the many strong arguments, to favour our
opinion; it is rather a delicate plant, and should be kept in a dry and
warm part of the greenhouse, where it will flower from the month of
July, till November; growing three feet high, if planted in light sandy
peat; and is easily propagated by cuttings. Although, this is the only
species at present, in cultivation with us; there is little doubt from
the number of handsome specimens of other species, which we have seen,
in the different herbariums from Botany Bay; and from the character of
the seeds, much resembling those of the Diosma, which are not subject to
rapid decay; but we shall very soon be possessed of many more of this
very beautiful Genus. Our drawing was made from the nursery at
Hammersmith, where it was raised from seeds, in the year 1790. The
generic title of this plant, is derived from the name of an English
botanist at Norwich, Mr. James Crowe, F. L. S. see Linn. Tran. Vol. IV.

chives, we make no scruple to follow such good authority. It is named
after Mr. James Sowerby, so well known for his numerous botanical
engravings, as attached to different works; but especially, for his
excellent coloured plates of English plants. Messrs. Lee and Kennedy of
Hammersmith, were the first, who raised this plant from seeds, received
in 1792 from Botany Bay. Our drawing was taken in May 1798, the first
time it flowered there; it is the full size of the plant, the
flower-stem cut off, it being twice the length of the leaves. There is
no smell to any part of the plant; but nevertheless, it is very
desirable in the greenhouse, from the character of the flowers, which
retain their colour with little change, till the seeds are perfected. To
increase it, the roots may be parted early in spring, and should be
planted in peat earth.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

the plants which have been introduced from thence, to Great Britain.
From the living and dead specimens we have already seen, this Genus bids
fair to rival Protea in the number of its different species; from which,
nature seems to have marked but a slight line for Generic distinction.
Our figure was taken from a plant now in flower in the greenhouse, (we
believe for the first time in Europe,) at the agreeable retreat of J.
Ord, Esq. Purser’s-cross, Fulham, being nearly seven feet high; indeed,
we have seen specimens which have attained to twelve feet, and more. It
is increased by cuttings, and will grow in almost any earth. The cones
to which the seed-vessels are fixed, something resemble those of the
stone pine, but much larger, and the wood more hard: the seeds are
inclosed in capsules which are placed at a considerable distance from
each other, at irregular intervals; the spaces filled up with long harsh

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">To</span> G. Hibbert, Esq. of Clapham Common, we owe the introduction of this
beautiful little Moræa, he having received it from his collector at the
Cape, in the spring of 1799. It is certainly a perfectly new species
here, and we believe has not been seen to flower in Europe before, as it
is not in the extensive Collections, of the Emperor of Germany; at least
it is not to be found amongst the many figured by Professor Jacquin. The
very short duration of the blossoms, at first, had determined us to name
it specifically, fugax; but finding we were anticipated in that name, by
Jacquin, in his Hortus. III. tab. 26, we have adopted that of tricolor.
The drawing was made at Clapham this year, in October; although we
conceive the regular season for its blowing would be, June, or July, if
planted like other Cape bulbs in autumn. The only means of seeing this
plant in perfection, is, by keeping it entirely from the air when near
flowering, as it is too delicate to bear the least exposure; it begins
to expand about twelve o’clock, and is quite decayed by three. From
every appearance, without a supply from the Cape, this delicate little
bulb will, (as many others have) be soon lost to this country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

seldom last beyond the second year. From their short duration, it is
necessary to keep up a succession yearly; which is done, by making
cuttings of them early in spring. Our drawing represents the branch of a
plant, in the collection of R. James, Esq. Grosvenor-place, taken in the
month of July 1799. It is a very shewy greenhouse plant, and should be
plotted in rich mould; if kept free from damps, will continue to flower

honey cups, which are wanting in the other; the same natural appearance
however of the junction of the supporters of the tips, being common to
both. From this small change of the identity of character, so necessary
in our artificial system, they are thrown to a wide distance in
classification; the one standing in the fifth, the other in the
sixteenth class! The Mahernia odorata is from the Cape of Good Hope, and
was sent in seeds to England about the year 1792. It is but a
short-lived greenhouse plant, and must be raised every two years, at
least, from cuttings; which should be made about the beginning of March,
and placed on a gentle hot bed, they will by this means become good
sized plants by midsummer. The flavour of the blossoms is exactly that
of the Jonquil, it continues to flower through the whole year, but is as
yet to be found in few collections, although from its different
attractions we have no doubt of seeing it soon in most. Rich earth, of
old cow dung, and loam, seems to be the soil it most affects. Our
drawing was made at the nursery Hammersmith, in July 1799.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">This</span> species of Trumpet Flower, is a native of Norfolk Island in the
Pacific Ocean, lying in 29 deg. 2 min. south lat.; therefore, must be
kept with us as a greenhouse plant; and, as a creeper, may be placed to
twine round the pillars, or to cover trellis work; being of quick growth
(if planted in peat earth,) and flowering abundantly from the month of
March, ’till June. It is easily increased by cuttings, made in the
spring, or by suckers, which it frequently produces from the root. The
plant from which our drawing was made, flowered (and we believe for the
first time in England) in 1798, in the collection of J. Vere, Esq.
Kensington Gore.</p>

<p>Naturalists, when in detailing the history of the various articles
passing under their review, should receive with caution, any matter
which seems tending to the marvellous; but for the authenticity of the
authority, from whence we are furnished with the account of the
singularly pestiferous character of this plant, we can with confidence
pledge ourselves. Colonel Paterson, now commanding at Port Jackson, New
Holland, sent the seeds from Norfolk Island, when he was stationed
there, to Messrs. Lee and Kennedy Hammersmith, who first raised it, in
the year 1793. The N. I. Trumpet Flower is, in its native soil, a
deciduous plant; upon the return of the season, in which the young
tendrils begin to shoot, and the leaves begin to appear; within fifteen,
or twenty days, the whole plant is entirely covered with a white downy
insect, of the genus Aphis, something similar to our blight; which, in a
very short time from their first appearance on this plant, become so
completely dispersed over every vegetable production, that scarce a
green leaf is to be seen through the whole extent of the island. So
great a plague was this insect thought to be, from its effects on
vegetation, by those who were sent to colonize the island, that it was
considered as one of the principal reasons for abandoning the
settlement.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

no doubt, the occasion of its having been as often lost to us for a
time. To the Dutch we are indebted for the last introduction of it to
this country, about four years since, amongst many others; from their
immense collections of Cape bulbs at Haarlem. Although the root is
particularly susceptible of wet, yet, by timely taking up the bulb, even
before the upper part of the plant is decayed; and keeping it entirely
free from moisture, till it is again planted in October, there will be
little danger of its perishing. Our figure was taken in the month of
June 1799, at Clapham, from a plant in the Collection of G. Hibbert,
Esq. Light sandy peat, with a small portion of rotten old cow-dung, will

titles: but perhaps, to none of the former more aptly could it have been
applied; (especially this species, as the Greek word Ήράνθεμον, a
compound of Ής the spring, and ἀνθέω to blossom, fairly indicates;)
since the E. pulchellum first begins to flower in January, and continues
to blossom till May. Linnæus in treating this Genus, acknowledges to
have seen but one imperfect specimen; and from this circumstance, left
the description of the seed-vessel, and seed, to be determined by future
Botanists; as yet, that has not been accomplished, even by the
indefatigable and accurate Schreber; indeed, had the character of the
pointal been likewise omitted, it would have been as well; since, in
place of one, the two unequal summits, (which might escape observation
in a dried specimen, from their disproportion in length, and upright
situation;) point out a stronger Generical distinction from Justicia, to
which it much affines, than either, the regular shape of the limb of the
blossom, or the situation of the chives. Our species is a native of the
coast of Coromandel, in the East Indies, and was first received in seeds
from Dr. Roxburg, at the Royal gardens Kew, in the year 1796. It is a
most desirable plant, for although it has hitherto been kept in the
hot-house, we have no doubt from its flowering and thriving there, with
so little care, in any situation; but that it will soon be considered as
a proper inhabitant of the greenhouse. It is with the greatest ease, and
certainty, increased by cuttings. Our drawing was made this month, from
a plant in flower at the Hammersmith nursery.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

ever, we believe, are perfected with us; from which circumstance, it is
to be found in very few collections. Our drawing was made from a plant,
in the possession of G. Hibbert, Esq. Clapham, about the middle of July
1799.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">We</span> are happy in having procured for the entertainment of our botanical
friends, a specimen of so singular a plant as the Septas: which, from
the conformity of its constituent generic characters in point of
numbers, has given it the title it bears and forming for itself an order
of plants, in which it stands alone. No plant is better known to
botanists than Septas by name; but as yet, there exists only one
miserable uncoloured figure of it; which is to be found in the Mantissa
of Plukenet, tab. 340, fig. 9. The first plants seen of Septas in
England, were purchased in roots from Holland, under the name of
Saxifraga Tuberosa, by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy Hammersmith. The
beginning of August this year, a drawing was taken from a plant in the
collection of G. Hibbert, Esq. Clapham, he having received some fine
bulbs of it, in the spring, from his collector at the Cape. There are
few plants rival Septas for beauty that are of equal size; it is
herbaceous, should be removed from its pot when in a state of inaction,
and dried like the Anemonie. The bulbs may be cut, or parted at the time
of removal for propagation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>Camellia with shorter and broader leaves; flowers double and striped.</p>

<p>In hopes that the subject will plead our excuse, in thus again,
obtruding a kind of nonentity, in reference to the sexual system, on our
scientific friends; and that a figure, of so rare, and beautiful a
plant, would be agreeable to all; we have, once more, put by the
etiquette of science, for the charms of beauty; yet for this deviation,
we think an apology necessary, as it is undoubtedly not conformable to
the plan of our undertaking.</p>

<p>This variety of the Camellia Japonica, is of the same date in our
gardens, as the double white, and was introduced through the same
medium. As yet this plant is found in but very few collections, and is
sold at a very high price; not being of free growth, few cuttings, or
grafts can be obtained. It has hitherto, been treated as a hothouse
plant; but there is no doubt it is equally hardy with the common sort,
upon which, all the plants we have as yet seen, and indeed those that
were first imported from China, were grafted; an instance in proof, that
horticulture must have, there, attained to a considerable degree of
perfection, in the operative part: as well as, that possessing double
flowering varieties, of their most beautiful plants, which are only
produced by a series of cultivation, for ages; incontestably proves the
antiquity of the art, (if any fresh proofs were necessary,) in that
country. Our figure was made from a drawing taken partly, from a plant
which flowered in August last year, in the collection of J. Hibbert,
Esq. Clapham; and partly from one now (April) in full bloom, in the
conservatory of R. H. James, Esq. Grosvenor-Place; the only ones we have
as yet seen in flower; wherefore the time of flowering cannot as yet be
fixed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">This</span> curious little plant, has been figured by professor Jacquin in his
Ic. rar. 2. tab. 363, under the name of Crinum Tenellum; Thunberg, (who
no doubt saw the living plant) in his Prodromus, p. 58, gave it first,
the specific title of Spiralis, which to us seems the best possible, we
have retained it; although, we differ from him as to the Genus, and
which there is no doubt every botanist will, on the examination of the
figure, with its appendages. That this plant should ever have been
placed under Hæmanthus, by any botanist, is certainly matter of wonder,
yet the point is too clear to be contended; scarce one of the essential
constituent characters, of the genus, are to be found in our plant, and
yet so perfectly in every part answering to Crinum. In Hæmanthus, the
fence is composed of many leaves; the segments of the border, standing
upright; the Chives longer than the blossom, and fixed into the tube;
the Summit simple! &amp;c. &amp;c. We submit this, nevertheless, with deference
to superior judgments, as a late publication of much repute, has this
plant, under the Generic title we have rejected. The drawing was made in
the beginning of March, this year, at Messrs. Lee and Kennedy’s,
Hammersmith; by whom, it was received from the Cape of Good Hope in
1792. It is a very hardy bulb, requiring no more protection than a pit,
to secure it from the frost. It increases but slowly by the root, but
occasionally produces ripe seeds; and should be kept constantly in its
pot, in a mixture of peat and loam.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

most singular little plant, but we much fear will prove a fugitive to
us; like the Ferraria, (to which in many particulars it very nearly
affines) its beauty is but of a few hours duration: indeed, so short is
the period, that had not Mr. Hibbert taken a sketch of it, whilst in
perfection; and from which our drawing was completed, we could not have
accomplished a figure of it. As yet, the true season of its flowering
cannot be ascertained; but, it was in the month of October, that the
plant flowered last year 1779; the bulbs having been received, from the
collector for the Clapham collection, still at the Cape, in the spring
of the same year. The treatment for this, appears to be the same as that
necessary for most Cape bulbs; light sandy peat, a little warmth when
approaching to flower; and to be removed from the pot afterwards.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>

nearly half filled with broken tiles, and keep them on a shelf of the

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">This</span> handsome variety of the common Pomegranate, (for it cannot be
considered as a species,) will, it is to be hoped, prove an agreeable
addition to our gardens; though not as a fruit tree, yet as an
ornamental plant, of the middling hardy class. Indeed we have little
doubt of this, if we may judge by analogy, from its deciduous character,
or from its natural affinities; as the other sorts of this species, viz.
single red, double red, yellow flowered, and another new variety with
large red blossoms and larger leaves, all endure our winters, with
little, or no protection, in the southern, or western counties of the
island; and are all natives of the same clime: from whence, no doubt,
they, like the Orange-tree, &amp;c. &amp;c. have been originally transported;
though at present considered as indigenous, to all the different
countries on the coasts of the Mediterranean sea, where the single red
is cultivated for its fruit; the agreeable acidity of which, is
considered as a great luxury, in allaying the thirst occasioned by the
intense heat, of those parching regions. In the month of April last year
1799, a fine branch, in full flower, was obligingly communicated by Lady
Hume, from her select collection at Wormley Bury, Herts; from which our
figure was taken, and where it was then flowering for the first time in
England. Her Ladyship had received the plant, amongst a number of
others, from China, in the year 1796. The fruit did not ripen, which we
attribute to its being kept in the hothouse, to which situation, all
plants coming from the East, are necessarily consigned on their first
importation. The mode of increasing it is certain and easy, by cuttings,
or layers; and it grows most luxuriant in light earth, composed of
rotten leaves or rotten dung, and light sandy loam.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">From</span> the number of different new and old known species, of this genus,
which we have been enabled to examine this spring; and of which drawings
have been made, (a figure from one of them being intended to be given in
each successive No. till they are finished;) we are more fully
confirmed, in what was asserted in a former part of the work, that V.
Arctostaphyllus, with the greater part of those plants, now known as
Vacciniums, should be placed in Decandria. It is true, a certain
latitude has been given by Linnæus, in an observation on the genus, by
allowing, that a fourth in addition to the usual number is frequently
found, in the different parts of the flower. But when so essential a
part of the fructification is, with a very few exceptions, constant
through a numerous genus, we cannot but think, in a system, founded
chiefly on that basis, that in such case, the mere character of the
fruit should give way to first principles; and that those with ten
chives should be placed to Andromeda. Or, if the distinction of a dry,
from a moist capsule, should be thought of sufficient weight, on which
to form a new genus, those species, with ten chives, and berries, might
be so arranged. Indeed, the difference in the general habit, of those
with ten, from those with eight chives, would well warrant such an
alteration. But such a change we have declined making, upon the grounds
we have, and are determined to pursue; not to alter any established
name, if even a little erroneous; but only to point out the error, or
the apparent necessary alteration.</p>

<p>This species of Whortle-berry was first introduced, (according to the
Kew Catalogue,) in 1770, by Mr. William Young, from N. America; and is
consequently hardy enough to bear the severity of our common winters. It
should be planted in sandy peat earth, on a dry, sheltered border. It is
propagated by layers, which should be put down in spring, and taken off
the succeeding summer. The leaves of this species are deciduous, when
planted in the open ground; but, if kept in the greenhouse, where it
will be found very ornamental, it becomes an evergreen. Our figure was
made at the nursery, Hammersmith, in May this year.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">From</span> the number of species of this genus of plants, already in Britain,
we may conclude, that it is one of the most extended in New South Wales;
twelve distinct ones have already flowered, drawings of most of them we
have, which will be brought forward in due course. Dr. Smith, in the
third No. of New Holland Botany, has named this tribe of plants after
Dr. R. Pulteney, F. R. and F. L. S. of Blandford, Dorsetshire; well
known for his Sketches of the Progress of Botany in England. But there
is little doubt, that although no such kind attention as this of Dr.
Smith had been shewn, to perpetuate the name of Dr. Pulteney, he had, by
his excellent life of Linnæus, insured his own to live for ever. The
Pultenæas, in systematic order, rank after, but very close to Sophora;
but are little allied in general habit, as are few plants from that
country to those of any other. This species was first raised in 1792, in
many gardens about the metropolis the same year; but did not flower till
1796. It is a hardy greenhouse plant, generally flowering about the
month of May; but the blossom is of short duration. Sandy peat is the
soil it most approves; and its increase is produced, either from seeds,
which sometimes ripen with us, or from cuttings placed in gentle heat
about the month of May. The drawing was made from a plant in the
Hibbertian collection at Clapham, this year.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

Smith, in the third No. of his New Holland Botany, it had not then
flowered in England; and from the leaves only, of the dried specimens,
it was scarce possible to trace, amongst such a variety of new faces,
this species of Embothrium. It nevertheless was in many collections, and
in some, all the varieties, although it had not then flowered in any.
About the end of the year 1791 the seeds of this plant, with many
others, were received by Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, of Hammersmith,
transmitted to them from New South Wales, by Col. Paterson. As a hardy
greenhouse plant, it will always be coveted, as it is seldom without
flowers through the whole year. Our plant appears to differ
sufficiently, from the three varieties given by the Doctor, to form a
fourth; as the leaves on this are by no means constantly three together,
but are often scattered. We have notwithstanding nearly copied his
specific character. It should be planted in light sandy peat, and may be
increased by cuttings, or by seeds, which occasionally ripen, whilst the

which we have figured it, and by which it has been long known to most
botanists, at least by name; yet have we great ones, whether it ought in
any wise to be considered as such. Thunberg, perhaps the only botanist,
who has seen it in flower, thought so, and placed it to a genus he had
named Fabricia. Certainly no one character of the genus Hypoxis, can be
traced in the flower. The husk is of one valve, the petals not even
close at the base, the threads flat, the summits three, and
halbert-shaped, the shaft pillar-shape and short, &amp;c. But, as upon our
old plea, we do not choose to change generic names when long
established, this plant, for us, must still remain an Hypoxis; tho’ it
could not now be placed, at any rate, to Fabricia, as that title is
given to a family of plants, natives of New Holland. The star-flowered
Hypoxis is a native of the Cape of Good Hope, is rather a tender bulb,
and does not often flower. It was according to the Kew Catalogue first
introduced to the Royal Gardens by Mr. F. Masson, in the year 1788; but
as the time of flowering is not mentioned, we suppose it did not flower
there. The root should, like other Cape bulbs, be removed from the pot
after flowering, and replanted in October. It propagates itself pretty
freely by offsets, if planted in light sandy peat, mixed with a little
loam. The drawing was made in June, this present year, at the
Hammersmith nursery.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Creeping Epigæa is the only species of the genus yet in Britain; it
was first introduced by P. Collinson, Esq. in 1736, from N. America;
where it is found in most parts, from Virginia, as far north as Canada.
The flowers of this plant are extremely fragrant, and are produced from
March till May. Hitherto, very few situations have been found congenial
to its cultivation, or growth; indeed, so subject is it to perish from
the moisture, or changeableness of atmosphere in our winter months, to
which it is not subject in its native clime, being during that season
covered with a deep snow; that unless an occasional supply had not been
procured from America, the plant must, long ere this, have been lost to
us. The soil which appears best adapted for its preservation, is a light
sandy loam: if planted in the open air, it should have a sheltered
situation, on a dry border; but the most likely mode to preserve it, is
by keeping it as a greenhouse plant. It is with difficulty increased by
cuttings, but may be divided at the root, with success, in March. Our
figure was made at the nursery of Mess. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith,
this year, in the month of April.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">It</span> is to the curious and beautiful structure of the empalement, (the
flowers being nearly concealed within it,) that this species of Protea
owes its specific title, and for which it is so much admired. There are
different varieties of it, which are considered by Thunberg, in his
Diss. de Prot. of 1781, as distinct species; but which are certainly
only varieties of one stock: we have drawings of two of these, the one
flesh-coloured, the other white; and hope to be able to demonstrate as
just, our postulatum, when the synonims are given, as proposed, at the
close of this volume. This plant was first introduced to the Royal
Gardens at Kew, from the Cape of Good Hope, in 1786, by Mr. F. Masson:
it flowers at a very early age, and when the stem is not more than two
feet high, mostly from the centre or leading branch of the plant. It is
propagated by cuttings, which should be put in about the end of May,
three or four, at most, in a pot, filled with good stiff loam, which
should be pressed hard to the lower end of the cuttings, and the pot
placed under a hand-glass in the shade. When the plants are to be
removed into separate pots, it will be necessary to add a small portion
of peat earth to the loam, and place them in an airy and dry part of the
greenhouse. These directions are necessary to be observed, in the
culture of nearly every species of this extended genus. Our figure was
taken in the month of July 1799, from a plant in the Hibbertian
collection, Clapham-common.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>

Bucks. The genus Lachnæa has hitherto, with us, remained in obscurity;
as the L. Conglomerata has not as yet flowered, and the L. Eriocephala
was not in our collections till within these five years; about which
time it was introduced by Mess. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith, from the
Cape of Good Hope. It differs but little in habit from Passerina
Grandiflora, and until it flowered this year, was considered as a
variety of that plant. May be propagated with ease by cuttings, and
continues to flower from March till August. A mixture of peat and loam
is the soil it most approves; but it is very susceptible of damps.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span></p>

chives, five cells in the berry, and five segments in the borders of the
cup and blossom. It is an evergreen, and will live through a mild
winter, on a warm border; but cannot resist the cold of a severe one,
though a small degree of protection is sufficient for its preservation.
As a greenhouse plant, it is very decorative, flowering about June; in
which month this year our drawing was made, at the Hammersmith nursery,
from a plant in that collection. The pabulum best calculated to preserve
it in a flourishing state, is a mixture composed of sandy peat two
parts, and light loam one part. To propagate it, the younger branches
should be laid down about the end of May, and they will be rooted by the
ensuing spring.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span></p>

Chelones, &amp;c. of that country, is very subject to damp; but being partly
herbaceous, the root is most frequently preserved, although the upper
part has perished. Though it requires the protection of a greenhouse in
winter, it may be made an ornamental plant for the flower borders in
autumn, by putting single cuttings, in small pots filled with rich
earth, into the heat of a hotbed, early in March, they will be fit to
transplant into the open ground the latter end of June, and will flower
about August, continuing to blossom till destroyed by the frost; or if
taken up and put into large pots, will flower till Christmas. Our figure
was taken from a beautiful plant, in the collection of R. H. James, Esq.

genus; for certainly it does not well affine to the one here assigned
it, in several instances; but as our professed principles are, as rarely
as possible, to increase the number of genera, we have retained it under
Allium. The flowers of this plant are fragrant in the extreme, at night;
so much so, that one is sufficient to scent a large room; the flavour
something like the Heliotrope. Being a native of Barbadoes, from whence
it was sent by Mr. J. Ellcock in 1791, to Messrs. Lee and Kennedy,
Hammersmith, it requires the heat of a hothouse, where, without the
assistance of the bark bed, it will flower, and increase from the bulb
abundantly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">From</span> the Hort. Cantab. published this year, by the accurate Mr. J. Donn,
we learn that this fine species of Geranium was introduced to the Royal
Gardens, Kew, about nine years since; yet, till within these two years,
it has not been seen in any other collection. Our drawing was made in
July 1799, from a plant in the Clapham collection. This Geranium must be
treated rather as a dry-stove than as a common greenhouse plant, for it
affines much to G. Fulgidum, and a few others, which are inhabitants of
the sandy deserts of the more interior parts of Africa, and which
require more heat than is proper for those from Table Mountain, or the
vicinity of the Cape. It is propagated by cuttings made about the month
of March, and placed under a small glass, either in a hotbed, or in the
bark bed of the hothouse: it may be increased by the root likewise, and
from seed which is sometimes perfected. A compost of cow dung, at least
two years old, one part, sea sand one part, and light loam two parts, is
the most proper for many of the tenderer sorts of this genus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span></p>

medium we possess this new species of Crysanthemum, informs us, in his
catalogue for 1800, that it is a native of the coast of Barbary, and
from whence it was first received in 1797. The C. Tricolor is but of
annual growth, should be raised on gentle heat about March, and may be
either kept in pots, or planted in the open borders, where it will
flower from July till October; but much of the brilliancy of the flowers
will be lost, if treated in the last manner, as the least wet, or even
the dew, will affect their colours. The seeds are perfected in less than
a week, after the decay of the flower, and are produced in abundance.

been raised from seed, communicated by Mr. Donn to Messrs. Lee and

certainly its beauty must be great; as, even there, amidst that world of
beauties, it should be honoured with such a specific title; in which,

the year 1788; it is a very hardy bulb, the flowers continuing perfect
more than a week, and are not easily injured either by wind or rain. But
the greatest merit of this plant is, that the blossoms are only produced
when most of the other species of Ixiæ, Gladioli, &amp;c. have done
flowering; which is generally about the end of July. Before the stem
decays, the bulb should be taken from the pot, and dried. The increase
of this plant is not great, as seldom more than two roots are produced
from the old one. Our drawing was made at the Hammersmith nursery, in
1799. Willdenow has a Gladiolus from Jacquin’s Icon. Rar. under the
specific title here given to this, undoubtedly not the same plant; but
as our name is that by which this species is in general known, and by

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Genus Struthiola, from the few species yet known, has been but
slightly considered. Linnæus, at the end of his Generic Character,
affines it to Passerina; it is true, the habits of S. virgata, and S.
erecta, which are undoubtedly only varieties of the same stock, and the
only two he had seen, might lead to such a comment; but, from the seven
species of which we have drawings, all taken from living plants, and
which will be brought forward in due course, we consider them, as
perfectly distinct, in more essential characters than merely the number
of chives. The acute and diligent Willdenow, in his new edition of Sp.
Plant. enumerates five species from Thunberg, &amp;c.; but from his notes of
observation, prefixed to each, he had not seen either living or dried
specimens of any, but the two above named. The characters in which we
observe this genus to differ from Gnidia and Passerina, are, first, a
cup of two leaves, constant in every species we have examined, for they
cannot be considered as floral leaves, being attached to the base of the
blossom, and joined together at the bottom; secondly, the honeycup
forming a complete cincture to the mouth of the flower, and upon which
are seated, four, or eight, upright glands. This species of Struthiola
was first raised in England, at the nursery, Hammersmith, from the Cape
of Good Hope, in the year 1794. It is a tender green-house plant, and
very subject to be destroyed by wet; therefore, should be protected from
too much rain in summer, and kept in an airy part of the house in
winter. It is propagated by cuttings made in the month of May, or June,
and should be planted in light, sandy peat, mixt with about one sixth
part of loam. The flowers of this, as well as all the species we have
seen, are extremely fragrant in the evening, beginning to smell with the
setting sun, and continuing their flavour till morning. An agreeable
peculiarity attendant on most plants of this natural order, and on every
species of this genus, in particular, is, that they flower twice in the
year, about the month of March, and again in September; in which month,
last year, our drawing was made, from the Hibbertian collection, Clapham
Common.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

produced any perfect seed; although it has flowered abundantly these two
years, from May till October. It has something the habit of G. triste,
or the Night-smelling Geranium; but differs from that species, in having
a short shrubby stem, the leaves shorter and harsher, and the flowers
entirely without smell.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Downy-leaved Geranium, according to the Hort. Cantab. of Mr. Donn,
introduced from the Cape of Good Hope, in the year 1794, is a dwarf
growing, and rather delicate species, of this extended and very mutable
tribe of plants; producing its flowers about the month of August. It is
to be increased from the seeds, which sometimes ripen; or by cuttings,
taken off in the month of March, and placed on a gentle hotbed; but if
delayed to be made till much later, it will be found difficult to
propagate by this mode. Less of dung and more loam, than is necessary
for most Geraniums, will preserve this plant best through the winter; in
which season, it should be kept in a dry and airy part of the
greenhouse, to avoid the damps, which otherwise, often prove fatal to
it.</p>

<p>That the charm of novelty, however erroneous or absurd, has found at all
times its votaries, we have daily experience; therefore cannot wonder
at, though we may regret its consequent influence on the many, who wish
to signalize themselves, under its delusive banner. This observation
naturally obtruded on our imagination, upon the perusal of the last
Number of the Bot. Mag. where the Kidney-leaved <i>Crane’s-bill</i> is
mentioned as “<i>one of the rarest of the Geranium tribe</i>;” are we to
understand Geranium in this place as a new title for a natural order of
plants; or, as solely confined to one Genus? Poor Geranium! although
thou hast been so long excluded from thy station, in scientific English,
yet shalt thou not lose thy due weight, against all thy opponents, in
pure descriptive English prose; and perhaps some day may be deemed, by
the learned, worthy a place amongst English Genera. With Mr. Donn, we
humbly conceive the old title Crane’s-bill, as ill adapted to the three
Genera of M. L’Heritier; and that, if new Latin names are to be foisted
on us, for plants already well known, and settled, by that great master
of the science, Linnæus; to whose opinion ours shall ever bow, English
ones consonant, should be likewise adopted; and that Heron’s-bill for
Erodium, Stork’s-bill for Pelargonium, and Crane’s-bill for Geranium,
will prove no greater puzzle to the English Botanist. Unfortunately we
are, and have been, so attached to old fashions, that we still mean to
continue the title Geranium, as it is apparently best understood;
whether, in English or Latin, descriptive, or scientific; as long as the
public shall continue so honourably to patronize the Botanist’s
Repository.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">From</span> the eighth Ed. of Miller’s Dictionary, we learn that, this plant
was cultivated at the Physic Gardens, Chelsea, in the year 1765. That so
ornamental, and so easily propagated a plant as the Gaultheria, should
have been so little noticed, or cultivated in our gardens, is rather
singular; as, it is perfectly hardy in every exposure, an evergreen, and
from the beautiful appearance of the fruit and flowers, which come in
succession nearly through the whole year; must be considered, as one of
our prettiest creeping or dwarf shrubs, for the front of the shrubbery
borders, &amp;c. as it never rises higher than six, or eight inches; forming
a compact matted clump, which may be made to spread to a considerable
extent, if planted in light sandy peat earth. The very curious
conformation of the fruit, which is eatable, differing from every known
Genus of plants; as well as, the peculiar property of the leaves; point
out the Gaultheria, as a particular object for observation, and comment,
to the experimental Botanist. In Canada, North America, where it is
native, an infusion of the leaves is used as a substitute for tea; or a
few of them, either dried, or plucked fresh from the plant, when mixt
with the commonest bobea, communicate to it a flavour, equal to fine
Hyson.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">As</span> a native of the Helvetian Alps, the Purple flowered Gentian is
consequently, a hardy plant with us, requiring only to be planted in a
light soil; may be increased from the seeds, which are produced in
abundance, or by parting the root in autumn. The seeds are perfected,
within a fortnight after the flower is decayed; and should be sown on
light sandy peat, covering them very slightly, as soon as possible after
they have been dried.</p>

<p>There appears a strange variety of opinions amongst Botanists concerning
this, and two other species of Gentian, the Punctata and the Pannonica;
which, as many have observed, although denied by others, are only
varieties of each other; surely, a slight variation in height, the shape
of the divisions of the border, or what is of less consequence, (as they
vary, in that regard so much, on the same plant) their number; are not
of sufficient weight to form a specific distinction.</p>

<p>This plant is said, in the Hort. Kew. to have been introduced in the
year 1768 by Professor de Saussure: from what cause, we cannot judge, if
it is so old an inhabitant, why it should not be more plentiful with us;
as at present few collections possess it, and it is sold at a very high
price. Our drawing was made at the Nursery, Hammersmith.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

even in summer; the flowers, (as are most of this natural order,) are
extremely fragrant and continue in full perfection from March till June.
The mode of propagation is by cuttings, made in May, which should be

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">No</span> plant perhaps ever excited such universal admiration, as the Scarlet
Fuchsia; wherefore, the addition of a second species to our collections,
of so fine a Genus, must be considered as a very agreeable acquisition.
The Box Thorn-like Fuchsia, is a native of the North-west coast of
America; and was first brought to England, in the year 1796: it is
certainly, much more tender than the Scarlet Fuchsia, as the plant
constantly perishes, as low as to the earth, if not preserved in the
hothouse; but whether it is herbaceous the root surviving, we have not
sufficient experience to determine. The increase is certain and easy, if
cuttings are made, from the young shoots, early in March, and plunged in
a hotbed, or in the bark of the hothouse, six or eight in a pot; from
which they may be removed, about June, into large pots for flowering,
which will be from August till November. Loam, with a small portion of
rotten dung, is the soil it most approves.</p>

<p>The specific title we have adopted, is from the very great resemblance
the plant bears to Lycium afrum, or the Box-Thorn; although we have some
doubts, whether this species may not be the F. triphylla of Father
Plumier. But as the F. coccinea, as well as this plant, has frequently
the leaves growing by threes; we thought that, as it as yet had no
specific title with us, the character of the plant would be best
distinguished, by the name we have chosen.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Cortusa-leaved Geranium is a tender plant, seldom growing to more
than a foot in height; producing its blossoms, which are extremely
fragrant, in erect bunches, from the summit of the branches, and must be
protected, through the depth of winter, in the hothouse. The propagation
is both slow and difficult, as it rarely perfects any seeds, and forms
but few branches. The cuttings when taken off, which ought to be done
about the end of May, should be exposed to the sun, till the part where
cut has formed a tough coat over the wound, which will take place in two
or three days; when they will not be so subject to rot from the moisture
of the earth, as if planted when just taken from the plant. These
instructions are necessary to be observed, in the propagation of all the
thick-stemmed Geraniums, by cuttings. A mixture of sandy peat, with a
small quantity of old rotten dung, will prove the best compost for
preserving this plant. Our drawing was taken this year, in July, at the
Hammersmith nursery. A mistake has arisen with regard to the name of
this species of Geranium; which was evidently not known to any botanist,
antecedent to its being brought to England in 1786 by Mr. A. Hove, a
native of Poland, from the south west coast of Africa, and found by him
in about the 23d degree of south latitude. Professor Martyn, in his new
edition of Miller’s Dictionary, article Pelargonium 43, has taken for
granted that this is the plant designed by Professor Jacquin, where he
treats of G. cortusæfolium; giving the G. tabulare of Burman, Linnæus,
&amp;c. as synonymous to it; but undoubtedly, no such intention could be in
the Professor, as the uniting these two plants, which are so entirely
dissimilar; but only an unfortunate inclination to alter an old
established name, for one, which he conceived more appropriate to a well
known, common species; whence the confusion; the constant consequence of
such useless alterations, whether generic or specific.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span></p>

which we have seen above six or seven. Nevertheless, upon the authority
of Prof. Jacquin, who in his Icones 2. tab. 258, has figured it under
this name specifically; and as it has been continued as such, by the
accurately discriminating and indefatigable Willdenow; (to whose
labours, all lovers of the science are so much indebted, for his
invaluable, and copious new Edition of the Species plantarum,) we have
thought it but right to acquiesce, without alteration in the name
adopted by them. For the management of this plant we must refer our
readers to the G. alatus, Pl. VIII. Vol. I. of this work.</p>

<p>The Helmet-flowered Gladiolus was not seen in England, till the spring
of the year 1800; when the roots were received at Clapham, from the Cape
of Good Hope, sent by the Collector there, for the Hibbertian
collection, amongst an infinite number of others; many having flowered
this year, of which we have drawings, by permission of the proprietor,
and are destined to enrich the Bot. Rep. being perfectly new to this
country. The figure of this plant was taken in August, but the regular
season of its flowering, must be much earlier (if planted with the other
Cape bulbs in October,) that is to say, about the month of May or June.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Thunbergia, here figured, is a native of the East Indies, from the
Coromandel coast; was introduced to Britain in the year 1796, at the
same time with the Ixora pavetta, by the Hon. Lady Dowager De Clifford.
It is easily propagated, by cuttings, or from the seeds, which ripen
with us: it should be kept in light, rich earth in the hothouse; where
it will flower from May, till September; in which month this year our
drawing was taken at Kensington Gore from a plant in the collection of
James Vere, Esq. But although Dr. Roxburgh’s reason for adopting the
specific character he has given it, that the place where it grows is
sweet scented, though the plant is not, seems rather a little strained,
we have not thought it right to alter it; as unquestionably, any name
would have been equally appropriate, since neither the flowers, or any
part of the plant, root or branch, has the least scent.</p>

<p>The plant from which this genus was originally formed by the younger
Linnæus in his Sup. Plant. P. 46, is a native of the Cape of Good Hope;
and we have our doubts, whether this plant ought to be placed with it;
for although it accords in the essential character, of a double cup, the
only one thought necessary, by Linnæus, to divide it from Barleria; yet,
from the number of parts in which it differs from his generic character,
such as the shape of the blossom, the length of the pointal, the
situation and shape of the chives, the very different shape of the
seeds, &amp;c. we are led to think, it ought to be considered as a distinct
Genus. But in following such good authority as the able and learned Dr.
Roxburg, it is to be hoped, we shall stand excused in continuing the
same name he has assigned it, without alteration at least, if not
without comment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span></p>

as well as most of the West India Islands, was first received, in
plants, from the island of St. Vincents, in the year 1797, by Thomas
Evans, Esq. of Stepney; in whose collection it first flowered, in
September 1798, when our drawing was taken. This plant requires a
considerable degree of moisture and heat, as well as much root room and
rich earth, to make it flower in perfection; as it seldom opens its
blossoms freely without such treatment, and even with such assistance,
they are to be seen but for a few hours in that state. It propagates
from the roots, throwing up a number of suckers from the joints, which
are formed at a considerable distance from the plant. The younger
Linnæus in his Sup. Plant. of 1781, p. 158, has described this plant
under our specific title, but different in some few points; which appear
to arise more from his ideas of the various parts, than from any real
difference in the plant itself. Swartz in his Obs. 98, gives sheaths to
his plant, which Linnæus, we presume, denominates flower stem leaves,
&amp;c. yet we have no doubt, but they have both described the same plant;
and perfectly agree with Willdenow and Martyn, that the H. psittacorum
of both authors is the same, and have as little of this being the
plant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span></p>

a hardy green-house plant, and makes a very handsome climber, for
trellis, or pillars in a conservatory. Its growth is very rapid, and its
flowers which are very brilliant and specious, continue in succession
from May till September. The increase is certain and easy from cuttings,
made in the month of May, and placed on a gentle hotbed, or plunged in
the bark-bed of the hothouse. It delights in a light sandy peat soil.
Our drawing was made from a plant, in the collection of the Hon. Lady

<p>As hitherto this tribe of Plants has not been given to the public by any
truly established name; (the different species having been erroneously
titled Dillenias, which have many pointals,) and as we find it to
differ, from any yet described Genus, we have named it after G. Hibbert,
Esq. of Clapham Common, Surry; whose knowledge and fervor in botanical
pursuits, as well as liberality in his endeavours to enrich our
collections, from every quarter of the globe, but especially from the
Cape of Good Hope, has not been exceeded by any; and we are well
assured, no name deserves a place, on botanical record, more than that
of <span class="smcap">Hibbert</span>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span></p>

simplicifolium of Forster, which he describes as a native of the
Friendly Isles, in the South Seas; and likewise from the J. oblongum of
Burman, which is given (but with a query) as a synonim to the J.
simplicifolium of the former Author by Willdenow, in his Sp. Plant. p.
38, Part I. In the year 1792, the seeds of this plant were received by
Messrs. Lee and Kennedy, Hammersmith, with the Bignonia pandorana, and
many others, communicated by Colonel Paterson, then commanding a
detachment stationed for a time on Norfolk Island, where it is native.
To the green-house it is a considerable acquisition, either for a
climber, or otherwise, as it is rarely without blossoms from July, till
the end of November; being rather more tender than many of its
congeners, which are in general destined to that station; it should be
placed as nigh the flue, in as dry and airy a part of it as possible. A
light, sandy peat soil, without mixture, is the most congenial to its
growth; and it is increased by cuttings, made in the month of March,
put, from 12 to 20, according to the size of the pot, under a small
bell-glass, in the before-named earth, and plunged either in the
bark-bed of the hot-house, or in the heat of a common hot-bed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span></p>

<p>Having received a most beautiful branch, of this magnificent plant from
the collection of the Hon. the Marchioness of Rockingham, at Hillingdon,
near Uxbridge; the impulse was too strong to be resisted, of giving a
figure of it in the Bot. Rep. although against our general proposals, as
this is certainly, neither a new, or rare plant; having been introduced
so early as 1690, by Mr. Bentick. We therefore beg the indulgence of our
friends, in this instance; for although the flower is common, and there
are many figures of it, in different works, as, Rheede’s Hort. Malab.

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">This</span> conspicuously handsome plant was introduced by W. Forsyth, Esq. to
the Chelsea Gardens in the year 1782, from the island of Bourbon, now
the Isle de la Revolution, near the coast of Madagascar, in the Indian
Ocean. It grows to a very considerable height, perfectly straight, and
polished in the stem, something like the Bamboo Cane, from which
appearance, till it flowered, it had gone by the name of the fishing rod
plant. It must be kept in the bark-bed of the hothouse in rich mould,
and should be removed from its pot but seldom, the roots being extremely
tender and brittle. The propagation is slow and difficult, as well from
the great tendency the part has to rot, where cut, as from the
unfrequency of its throwing out any side shoots from the stem. Our
drawing was made in July this year, at the Hammersmith nursery; though
we understand it flowered in the extensive collection of the Right Hon.
the Earl of Tankerville at Walton-upon-Thames, some years since.</p>

<p>Having followed Willdenow, rather than Jacquin, in the Generic name of
this plant, our reason is, each species which has hitherto been thrown
to this Genus, since its first formation, might well make a distinct
one; if every generic or even essential, character, was to be critically
attended to. The fruit forming the principal essential character, a
specimen of which we have seen, containing two large seeds like C.
Manghas, determined us in our adoption.</p>

<p>The descriptions and figures of the two plants, given by Professor
Jacquin in his Icon. rar. 2, and Collect. 4, under the genus Ochrosia,
are, we conceive, only different specimens of our plant; and are both,
as well as Dryander’s critique on Gmelin (see Linn. Trans. Vol. II. p.
227) defective; neither of them having seen but <i>dried</i> specimens,
without the fruit; as in this natural order of plants, the flowers being
mostly fleshy, many of the principal characters are destroyed in the
process of drying; and of course, in such case, must lead to error.
Jacquin’s character of <i>maculata</i>, quoted by Willdenow as a specific
title, though he has rejected the Generic, we suppose, must have been
taken from the small blotches on the lower, and which sometimes pervade
the upper surface of the leaves, but found only when in the last state
of decay, or when artificially dried to preserve them; as by the
pressure necessarily employed to that end, the waved, and most
ostensible character of the living plant, is done away. As to the C.
parviflora of Forster being the same, as either, the Ochrosia borbonica
or O. maculata of Jacquin, we must beg leave to dissent from the severe
criticiser of Gmelin; upon whose authority, nevertheless, Willdenow has
been led to exclude, even as a synonim, the O. borbonica of Prof.
Jacquin, which perhaps, if it were not for the increasing of Genera,
ought to be the name of the plant.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span></p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Ragged-leaved Geranium may be considered as an herbaceous plant, for
it rarely retains its leaves longer than September; and when in a state
of inaction, should be watered but sparingly, otherwise the root will be
subject to rot. It may be increased by parting the roots about March,
which should be afterwards planted in rich mould, and placed on a shelf
in the hot-house; where they will flower in May or June. From an
imported plant, in the Hibbertian collection, our drawing was made this
year.</p>

<p>A continual harping on the same subject, may perhaps appear rather
tiresome; but, as almost every real new species of Geranium, which falls
under our observation, seems to add a fresh proof of the futility of the
new arrangement, we cannot forbear noticing it. This species, for
instance, has every other essential generic character of Monsieur
L’Heritier’s Pelargonium, but unfortunately the most essential. Upon an
accurate examination of a number of flowers, before they had expanded,
(the only time when it can be truly ascertained), in no one instance,
was there more than five tips to be found. Where to place it, with
Erodium, or Pelargonium?<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span></p>

November. It is most difficult, or indeed almost impracticable, to
increase it, as it puts out no side shoots, and certainly damps off, if
laid down, where it touches the earth.</p>

<p>From Boerhaave’s having arranged this species of Protea, (See his Index
to the Leyden Garden, Part 2. from P. 185 to 189,) with his
Lepidocarpodendrons, after <i>fig. 187</i>, which is our P. mellifera;
Willdenow has been led into an error; since he has given this plant, the
188 Fig. of Boerhaave, as a synonim to P. speciosa, which ought not to
be so taken, unless we understand, that he meant all his
Lepidocarpodendrons as only varieties of each other; the principal
distinguishing feature, in P. speciosa, being the incurved and fringed
character, of the inner scales of the empalement.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span></p>

the Cape of Good Hope, and there, is treated as a distinct species,
under the name of I. deusta. From the number of drawings we possess of
this tribe of plants, having nineteen distinct varieties of this one
species, and in the close investigation we have given them, in their
flowering, for a number of years; having found them to sport in colour,
&amp;c. from the same root, but much more so from seed; enables us
decisively to place this plant as a variety to I. crocata. It is one of
the most hardy of the Genus, and propagates itself by the root. The
flowers are produced about May, in which month 1799, our drawing was
taken, at the Hammersmith nursery; since, we have not seen it in any
collection; which leads us to think it is not a free blower, as the
roots are not scarce.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span></p>

purple flowers; we cannot but consider this, which never rises to more
than a foot and a half or two feet in the stem, with white flowers,
excepting a small streak of red at the base of the petals, as a distinct
and new species. It is a native of the Cape, and was received in seeds,
from thence, in the year 1794. As a hardy green-house plant it is most
ornamental; the blossoms, which are quite reflexed when full blown,
being produced in succession from March till November, upon every part
of the plant. It is increased by cuttings made in May, and placed under
a hand-glass on a shady border. Light loam with a small mixture of peat,
it the best soil to make it flourish.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_547">[Pg 547]</a></span></p>

plant at best, as it seldom survives the second winter, and but rarely
the first. If the seeds are sown in the month of March, the plants will
flower the ensuing autumn, and generally produce ripe seeds, if kept in
a sheltered and warm situation. This plant is unquestionably the true
Erodium of L’Heritier, and those who admit of that innovation, being the
one, apparently, upon which he formed his Generic distinction; as we

Catalogue, Vol. II. p. 12, from North America, in the year 1770 by Mr.
William Young; but nevertheless, although said to be an inhabitant of
our gardens so long as 20 years, it is, we believe, known to very few
cultivators. It is a deciduous shrub, growing to the height of about two
or three feet; and will, in general, survive the inclemency of our
winters.</p>

<p>It is increased with difficulty by layers, and the berries seldom ripen
with us; light peat earth, with a small mixture of loam, it thrives in
most. The drawing for our figure was taken, from the Hibbertian
collection, in July 1800. This species has likewise ten Chives, five
divisions of the cup, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>&amp;c.</p>

<p class="nind1"><span class="smcap">The</span> Cape Cyanella has been long known in many herbariums, and to most
botanists by name, but we much question whether a living plant has, till
now, been seen in our gardens. The description, in his dictionary, of a
plant cultivated by Miller in 1768, where he says, “the leaves are long,
narrow, with a groove on the upper side, the peduncle arising
immediately from the root, supporting one flower, of a fine blue
colour;” surely can have no connection with our plant, but in the colour
of its blossom. From every appearance of the plant, even in an abortive
specimen, more than one flower must be produced, if any. It is
enumerated, in the Kew Catalogue, as one of the species of Cyanella;
but, we suppose, only from an accepted idea, that the plant described by
Miller was the C. capensis; and, as having been cultivated in Britain,
might be therefore introduced with propriety into the book, though it
had never graced the garden; otherwise, if this plant, which is
incontestibly the true C. capensis of Linnæus, had ever been seen in the
Royal Gardens, no affinity would have been traced to that of Miller.</p>

<p>A few small inaccuracies occur in the generic character of this Genus,
which we have rectified; one is, that the inner, and not the outer
petals, are those which hang forward; the others may be observed by
those, who may consider them worthy notice. This species is a
bulbous-rooted plant, flowering freely in the green-house; although the
roots had been received, late in the season, from the collector for the
Hibbertian Collection now at the Cape; which, perhaps, is the reason the
flowers are produced at this time of the year (February). Mr. Allen
informs us, that, it has had no other treatment, than what is given to
Cape bulbs in general. From the swelled appearance of the seed-vessels
we have little doubt of ripe seeds being produced.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span></p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

provided that:

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
